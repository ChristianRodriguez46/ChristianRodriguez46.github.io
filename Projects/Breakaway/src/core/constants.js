   src/core/constants.js
   Every tunable number in Breakaway, in one place.

   Units: feet (FT), seconds (S), milliseconds (MS), radians (RAD),
   degrees (DEG). The unit is always in the name.

   Coordinates: origin at the top-left of the rink's bounding box.
   x runs across the rink (0 to 85 ft). y runs from the end boards
   (0) toward center ice (100). The skater attacks toward smaller y.

   Sections in this file
     1. Loop timing
     2. Rules and scoring
     3. Rink geometry (real NHL measurements)
     4. Bodies (playability sizes, larger than real)
     5. Skater
     6. Shots and puck
     7. Goalie tiers and difficulty
     8. Storage and settings
     9. Rendering and audio

   Troubleshooting
   - The game feels too easy or too hard: change the goalie tier
     table in section 7. The stats tests check that tiers stay in
     order (Rookie easiest), not exact rates.
   - A test fails after a tuning change: tests import these values,
     so a failure means behavior changed, not that a number is copied.
   - A frozen-object error ("Cannot assign to read only property"):
     these objects are frozen on purpose; copy before changing.
