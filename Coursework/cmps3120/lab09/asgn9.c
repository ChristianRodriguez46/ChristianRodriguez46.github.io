/* Standard binary search procudure to locate a solution in [L,R].

   If the number of solutions in [L,R] is even, we call this function with
   type = OR. The function returns the index of the leftmost one bit in the
   interval [L,R]. In this case, we make only OR range queries.

   If the number of solutions in [L,R] is odd, a solution can be found by
   making XOR range queries only, so we pass type = XOR. However it is now
   not guaranteed that the solution is leftmost or rightmost. Since the
   successive bisection of the search interval will ensure that one of
   the half-sized sub-intervals contains an odd number of solutions, we
   can pinpoint a solution using log_2 n XOR range queries.

   your private counts of range queries. At any point of time, an XOR-based
   binary search can be replaced by a (more powerful) OR-based binary
   search. In the following function, this is not implemented for the
